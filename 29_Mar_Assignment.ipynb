    "Let's delve into Lasso Regression and address your questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lasso Regression**, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a linear regression technique that, like Ridge Regression, aims to mitigate overfitting by adding a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. However, Lasso uses the L1-norm penalty instead of the L2-norm penalty used in Ridge Regression. This leads Lasso to shrink some coefficients all the way to zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating irrelevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically perform variable selection by setting the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This leads to a simpler and more interpretable model, especially in high-dimensional datasets with many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The interpretation of coefficients in Lasso Regression is similar to that of Ridge Regression and ordinary least squares regression. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In Lasso Regression, the main tuning parameter is the regularization parameter (λ, often denoted as alpha). By adjusting the value of λ, you can control the strength of regularization applied to the model. A higher value of λ leads to more shrinkage of coefficients and more aggressive feature selection, while a lower value allows for less shrinkage and more emphasis on fitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique and is not designed to handle non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. However, you can use basis expansion techniques (e.g., polynomial features) to transform the input features and make the problem more amenable to linear modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the penalty term used. Ridge Regression uses the L2-norm penalty, which shrinks coefficients towards zero but does not usually set them exactly to zero. In contrast, Lasso Regression uses the L1-norm penalty, which can lead to sparse solutions by setting some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features by shrinking the coefficients of correlated variables towards zero. This can help in reducing the variance of the estimates and improving the stability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The optimal value of the regularization parameter (λ) in Lasso Regression is typically chosen using techniques like cross-validation. By trying different values of λ and selecting the one that minimizes prediction error on a validation dataset, you can find the optimal balance between bias and variance in the model."
